        <h1>Edge of Tommorow Movie</h1>
        <p>
          When Earth falls under attack from invincible aliens, no military unit
          in the world is able to beat them. Maj. William Cage (Tom Cruise), an
          officer who has never seen combat, is assigned to a suicide mission.
          Killed within moments, Cage finds himself thrown into a time loop, in
          which he relives the same brutal fight -- and his death -- over and
          over again. However, Cage's fighting skills improve with each encore,
          bringing him and a comrade (Emily Blunt) ever closer to defeating the
          aliens.

        <h3>Movie Plot</h3>
        <p>
          When an alien race called Mimics invades and destroys Europe, London
          is the last resistance in the Old Continent. General Brigham plans an
          attack to France expecting to defeat the Mimics and orders Major
          William Cage, who is an American public relation officer, to cover the
          invasion. However Cage does not accept the assignment and threatens
          General Brigham to expose the casualties. He is arrested, accused of
          desertion, demoted to private and assigned to fight in the invasion
          under the command of the tough Sergeant Farell in the Heathrow Base.
          Humans are slaughtered in the invasion and Cage kills a Mimic and is
          sprayed by his blood; in less than five minutes combat, Cage dies.
          Surprisingly he awakes in the Heathrow Base and relives the same day
          over and over after dieing. Each time, Cage tries to fix the deaths of
          his squad and he meets Sergeant Rita Vrataski who asks him to find her
          when he awakes in the base. Rita brings Cage to meet Dr. Carter who
          explains to him that he killed an Alpha and his blood has given the
          ability to reset time. Further, the last hope of earth is the
          destruction of the Mimic leader, referred to as the Omega, who is
          hidden. Will Cage and Rita succeed in their solitary mission?
